Unless otherwise specified we will be using the most recent versions of Next.js & TailwindCSS for each project.

Next.js v15.3
https://nextjs.org/docs
- Make sure that we are using the rules for Next.js v15.3
- We will be using app router, and no src folder. 
- Please reference the docs at: https://nextjs.org/docs

TailwindCSS v4.1
https://tailwindcss.com/docs
- Make sure that we are using the rules for Tailwind CSS v4.1
- Please reference the docs, as much has changed: https://tailwindcss.com/docs
- Tailwind CSS v4 does not require a tailwind.config.js file. It utilizes a CSS-first configuration approach.
- Tailwind is now less about classes, and config files, and more about doing everything with css.
- Do as much styling as you can in the 'global.css' file. 
- Create variables in 'global.css' to maintain consistency, and customizability to the application.
- In most cases we will not be using a tailwind.config file, so try not to create one. 
- If you think you need a tailwind.config file, it's time to check the TailwindCSS v4.1 docs again.

https://ui.shadcn.com/docs
- 'shadcn-ui' was replaced by 'shadcn'
- The following syntax should be used:
- npx shadcn@latest init
- npx shadcn@latest add button
- we will add shadcn components whenever available for the task at hand
- you should customize shadcn components using color, size, border, and other styling variables in the global.css file.
